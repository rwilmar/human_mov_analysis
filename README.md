# Human Motion analysis

This is a tool for Visual Human Motion analysis from video files using DeepLearning models and bokeh visualizations.

Inferenced studios have been included for you to play with and improve according to your special needs; however new videos can be analyzed using the jupiter notebook included or trough the use of a python script.

Enjoy and share the voice.
